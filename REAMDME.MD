## **THIS RESEARCH PAPER WORK USING IT WITHOUT CONSENT WILL BE TAKEN AS PLAGIRISM WITH LEGAL CONSEQUENCES**

A stroke is an interruption of the blood supply to any part of the brain. If blood flow was stopped for longer than a few seconds and the brain cannot get blood and oxygen, brain cells can die, and the abilities controlled by that area of the brain are lost. In this Notebook we will use some features to see wether we will be able to predict the stoke or not? This is just a theoretical Machine Learning Model that will analyze the data and determine where the stroke can occur.

## Basic Outline For A Machine Learning Model:

Points to keep in mind when working with a machine learning model

1. Import the Data
2. Clean the Data
3. Split the Data into Training/Test Sets
4. Create Model
5. Train the Model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate and Improve

## Installation Instructions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open terminal and 'cd' to the directory where to saved the repository.
3. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Now start working on the repository.

## UNDER-DEVELOPMENT:

The project will be updated with more and more changes on a frequent basis due to it being a part of a research paper.
